# Summary

UD_Latgalian-Cairo is an example treebank to provide minimal dataset for Latgalian based on the Cairo sample sentences. Created by [AI Lab](http://ailab.lv) at Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Latvia.


# Introduction

This treebank was developed as a proof-of-concept by the team developing Latvian UD Treebank (UD_Latvian-LVTB). It contains the 20 Cairo example sentences and is as far as we are know the only Latgalian treebank in existance.
